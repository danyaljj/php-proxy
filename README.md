# php-proxy

This is slightly modified version of https://code.google.com/p/php-proxy/

The assumption is that, the main file `index.php` is located at `http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/~khashab2/files/profiler/profilerVisualizer/` which is not the root folder (and this can easily be changed to whatever you want)

Thanks to @codeviking for the major chunk of changes.
